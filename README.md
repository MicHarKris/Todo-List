# Todo List - Perfion
 Frontend Code Challenge for Boyum - Perfion

# Solution: 
I used a multi-component approach and navigate between the using Routing. This is the solution I have experience with, as it mirrors navigating around a pages on a website.
- I can see that a single-componnt solution, with elements being rendered as 'Modes' are shifted could just as well be implemented, but found that this was more representative of my experience.

# Comments
I have implemented none of the 'Nice to haves' described in the Challenge description, as they lie outside of my current skillset, but I will look into each of the concepts, so perhaps we can talk about how they would be relevant, when we have the technical interview?
